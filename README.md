# Alexa APL: Autoscroll text demo with Time and String.slice

## Description
This example shows how to autoscroll text in APL with Time and String.slice


## APL bug on older devices

~~**Warning**: this will not work with special characters as String.slice then chrashes the APL as can be seen in above example.~~

Meanwhile this bug has been fixed. If you still experience the bug then you should double check if you run the latest version of APL on your device. 

## Other solutions

[Another approach for scrolling texts](https://github.com/xeladotbe/apl-playground/blob/master/text-overflow-marquee.json) using vector graphics has been demonstrated by Alexander Martin (@xeladotbe).
